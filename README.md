# Server Utils
This is a small mod with server-side things I find useful.

Requires LuckPerms.

## Permissions
- `serverutils.death.printcoords`: When a player dies, their coordinates will be shown in chat if this is enabled.
- `serverutils.death.printcoords.public`: If this is enabled, the player's coordinates will be sent to all players
instead of just the one who died.

## TODO
- Send death messages for named entities and villagers to chat instead of only to the server log
